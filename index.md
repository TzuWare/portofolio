<h3>E.R.A.S.E</h3>
<p>
E.R.A.S.E is an abbreviation of ERP REMOVAL AND SAFETY ENGINE which is made to make sure children that play roblox doesn't meet any predators.  
This system is here because of the hard work of our team, E.R.A.S.E Softworks LLC.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
Our team will make a fake condo (porn) game on Roblox, but it isn't really a condo game.  
Our team mostly just puts a black screen and a timer with the text "Wait to be teleported to the real game".  
But the catch is our code secretly tracks them and sends all of the user info to our Discord webhook.  
Then we report all of those users to Roblox.
</p>

<h3>Does this really work?</h3>
<p>
Yes, it works. We've already caught 541 predators trying to join our Roblox game, and there will be more to come.
</p>

<h3>Why Are U Guys Doing This?</h3>
<p>
As I said, me and our team really care about children getting harmed by these predators,  
and we want to make sure Roblox is a safe place for children.
